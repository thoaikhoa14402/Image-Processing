# Image-Processing
Perform some basic processing functions:
1. Change the brightness.
2. Change the contrast.
3. Flip the image (horizontally / vertically)
4. Convert from RGB to grayscale.
5. Blending 2 gray images of the same size.
6. Blur an image.
7. Crop an image into Circle.
8. Crop an image into Ellipse.
-------------------------------------------------------
Note: Each pixel can be a value (grayscale image) or a vector (color image).

In this project, you are required to implement the following basic image processing functions:
    
1. Change the brightness

7. Write a main function (1 point) with the following requirements:

- Allow the user to input the image file name each time the main function is executed.
- Allow the user to choose an image processing function (from 1 to 6, for function 4 allow choosing between horizontal flip or vertical flip). Choosing 0 allows performing all functions with output file names corresponding to each function.         Example:
    - Input: `cat.png`
    - Function: Blur
    - Output: `cat_blur.png`
